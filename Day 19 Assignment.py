# Given an array arr of positive integers. The task is to swap every ith element of the array with (i+2)th element.

# Examples :

# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
# Output: [3, 2, 1]
# Explanation: Swapping 1 and 3, makes the array [3, 2, 1]. There is only one swap possible in this array.
# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Output: [3, 4, 5, 2, 1]
# Explanation: Swapping 1 and 3, makes the array [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]. Now, swapping 2 and 4, makes the array [3, 4, 1, 2, 5]. Again,swapping 1 and 5, makes the array [3, 4, 5, 2, 1].

def swapElement(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)-2):
        arr[i],arr[i+2] = arr[i+2],arr[i]
    return arr
print(swapElement([1, 2, 3]))
